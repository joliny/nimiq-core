# Security Policy

Nimiq is the worldâ€™s first browser-based blockchain and ecosystem. We look forward to working with the community to find security vulnerabilities in order to keep our protocol and official implementations as safe as possible.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Nimiq is committed to working with researchers who submit security vulnerability notifications to us to resolve those issues on an appropriate timeline and perform a coordinated release, giving credit to the reporter if they would like.

You can find all the information related to our vulnerability disclosure program [on its own section in our website](https://nimiq.com/bug-bounty).
