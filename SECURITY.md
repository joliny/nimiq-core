# Security Policy

Nimiq is the worldâ€™s first browser-based blockchain and ecosystem. We look forward to working with the community to find security vulnerabilities in order to keep our protocol and official implementations as safe as possible.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Nimiq is committed to working with researchers who submit security vulnerability
notifications to us to resolve those issues on an appropriate timeline and perform
a coordinated release, giving credit to the reporter if they would like.

Please submit security related issues to our [vulnerability disclosure program at
Hacker One](https://hackerone.com/nimiq) according to the policy discribed there.

If you prefer not to use Hacker One, you can also email us directly at `security@nimiq.com`.
